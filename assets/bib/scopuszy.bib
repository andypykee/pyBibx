	abstract = {In the era of information abundance, efficient text-based document retrieval and categorization are of paramount importance. This paper addresses the challenges posed by the exponential growth of digital content and the need for precise and automated document classification. Traditional manual categorization methods are no longer viable due to the enormous data and its structure. Consequently, automated text-based classification techniques, leveraging machine learning, natural language processing, and information retrieval, have gained prominence. Text-based classification faces challenges such as language ambiguity, document diversity, and scalability. A novel approach called k-means and cuckoo search optimization (KCSO) for hierarchical document categorization was proposed in this paper. KCSO combines k-means clustering with optimization techniques to enhance accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that KCSO outperforms traditional methods, achieving an average accuracy of 90–94%, making it a valuable tool for precise and efficient data categorization. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

	abstract = {BulliShield is an intelligent and portable application that combines detection, reporting, and AI-based counseling to offer an integrated approach to solve the widespread problem of cyberbullying. Within the system's user-friendly architecture, registered users can file complaints about possible instances of cyberbullying. Since institutions typically require the victim to submit photo evidence showing a snapshot of the whole electronic conversation with the bully, BulliShield allows victims to submit photo evidence of conversations with the bully. Our app extracts texts from those photos using OCR, identifies the language (currently, it can only detect hate speech in Bangla and English texts), and then employs appropriate machine/deep learning techniques to identify potentially offensive content in those texts, thereby helping the appropriate authority (for example, a proctor in the case of a university). BulliShield allows authorities to review complaints, call both parties for meetings, add notes, save their judgments to resolve the case, and so on - thereby acting as a fully functional system for handling cyberbullying cases. BulliShield ensures accountability and transparency throughout the resolution process by keeping the plaintiff informed about the current status of the complaint. BulliShield also offers an AI-based counseling component, giving the victims easy and free access to a technology that can help them develop resilience and emotional well-being. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Ensuring the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) is crucial. Most studies concentrate on fully pre-trained LLMs to better understand and improve LLMs' trustworthiness. In this paper, to reveal the untapped potential of pre-training, we pioneer the exploration of LLMs' trustworthiness during this period, focusing on five key dimensions: reliability, privacy, toxicity, fairness, and robustness. To begin with, we apply linear probing to LLMs. The high probing accuracy suggests that LLMs in early pre-training can already distinguish concepts in each trustworthiness dimension. Therefore, to further uncover the hidden possibilities of pre-training, we extract steering vectors from a LLM's pre-training checkpoints to enhance the LLM's trustworthiness. Finally, inspired by Choi et al. (2023) that mutual information estimation is bounded by linear probing accuracy, we also probe LLMs with mutual information to investigate the dynamics of trustworthiness during pre-training. We are the first to observe a similar two-phase phenomenon: fitting and compression (Shwartz-Ziv and Tishby, 2017). This research provides an initial exploration of trustworthiness modeling during LLM pre-training, seeking to unveil new insights and spur further developments in the field.

This approach allows for visual data analysis, identification of potential illegal activities, and provision of valuable insights to law enforcement agencies. Our approach, however, distinguishes itself from others by incorporating stance information, thereby capturing critical behaviors such as scanning surroundings, pacing, and sudden changes in direction that often precede criminal acts. Object recognition using deep learning poses a significant challenge in computer vision. It aims to identify objects from a vast array of predefined categories within natural images. Given the rapid advancements made in this field, our paper presents a comprehensive examination of region-based convolutional neural networks, specifically Faster R-CNN. The primary application of YOLOv5 in the context of object detection is to extract features from input images and detect criminal activities. We also conduct experimental analyses to compare various methodologies and draw meaningful conclusions. We propose future research directions for object detection systems and neural network-based learning, emphasizing a privacy-conscious approach integrating metadata and ethical considerations. Rigorous testing and continuous refinement enhance system reliability. Our approach leverages contextual awareness, accuracy, and precision to enhance crime detection and foster safer environments.

	abstract = {This study was motivated by the observed growth and increased significance of situation awareness (SA) in recent years. Despite its acknowledged importance, a notable gap exists in the literature regarding comprehensive systematic reviews of SA within the aviation sector. This gap spurred a meticulous analysis of 754 articles from the Web of Science (WoS) core database for bibliometric knowledge mapping. The primary aim was to fill this gap and acquire a holistic understanding of SA in aviation. This analysis highlighted the USA as the primary contributor to publications, with NASA leading among the institutions in paper contributions. Human Factors and the International Journal of Aerospace Psychology were the leading journals in this domain. This bibliometric study underscored the key focus on healthcare, aviation, performance, workload, and safety through co-occurrence and co-citation analyses. A chronological examination of keywords revealed a central research trajectory centered on patient and crew safety and the impact of automation on human performance in dynamic flight scenarios. Burst keyword analysis pinpointed leading-edge research in SA within healthcare, model, and system design, and the implications of human factors. This study explored the research landscape of SA in aviation using a bibliometric approach. The outcomes shed light on the present research landscape and expedite scholars’ comprehension of advancements in this pivotal field. Finally, we derived a conceptual framework using the main components found in the literature. This framework will help researchers identify the main dimensions of SA. © 2024},

	abstract = {The primary ethical issue arising from unfettered free speech online is the risk of remote assailants harming people who are particularly vulnerable to abuse, already suffering psychological damage, and/or likely to receive physical assaults. Despite any moral accountability, this chapter explores how various ethical frameworks might apply “emotion chips” to curb hate speech in order to delimit incivility. To appraise various algorithms’ relevance, this chapter contrasts both legal and societal norms afforded people doing business face-to-face in private spaces with those engaged online in anonymous enterprises. The spate of legal and sociological texts that arose to address issues related to unfettered free speech online have identified eight unintended consequences (the contagion of hate, self-censorship, online harassment, cybersexism, revenge porn, trolling, hate reading, and radicalization). This chapter next explores recently developed software tools that could potentially deter hate speech and then analyzes how self-learning AI could grasp empathy, which is central to applying more complicated ethical schemes. Imagining that this opportunity could work, this chapter evaluates how victims of unfettered online free speech might have fared under corrective algorithms that deployed either Kant’s moral maxim, utilitarianism, libertarianism, Rawls’ “worst-off fares best” scheme, or human rights. This chapter thus gauges which of these models best augments individual security and protects privacy. Just as ethical review boards determine medical research boundaries in order to protect human subjects and improve data collection/analyses, this chapter proposes that ethical review boards be established to assess the consequences of social media algorithms. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

It is widely spread across social media platforms in the guise of sardonic images, humorous jokes, and several other viral sensations. After the profound success of the late fusion technique that combines multimodal features, researchers have used stacked LSTM to extract textual features, whereas VGG16 has been used to extract visual features. Apart from this, BiLSTM and CNN have been used to extract contextual features. This study suggests a unique deep learning-based method for classifying objectionable memes within a multimodal dataset to address this problem. The proposed system uses machine learning to train the classifier on labeled data, which allows it to categorize the information accurately. The proposed system uses both text and image data.

By integrating these methods with various deep learning classifiers, we enhance our collective efforts to curb the spread of harmful content in digital spaces. We utilized an English dataset extracted from a larger multilingual corpus and preprocessed it using count vectorization for classification tasks. The evaluation metrics indicated a recall of 0.7103 and a precision of 0.7997. Our classification model used a Deep LSTM architecture with a batch size of 17. We are currently investigating the potential improvements in our data representation by incorporating a BERT-based model. This investigation is essential to optimize our classification performance, and the results should clarify the best practices for using advanced language representations to improve classification accuracy. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In today's digitally interconnected landscape, people have started expressing their thoughts and views on social media platforms. Expressing such freedom of thought occurs not only in English but also in a combination of native and English languages. Such a combination is called a code-mixed language. Expression of thoughts has positive as well as negative impacts, such as a decrease in privacy, cyberbullying, isolation, polarization, comparison, envy, and so on, posing significant challenges for maintaining a positive online environment. One of the negative outcomes can be the use of language that is offensive or disrespectful. We developed a novel framework to indicate the proliferation of offensive language. For this framework, we introduce a code-mixed corpus (Tamil, English, and Tamil-English text) for the detection of the offensive text within the comments. This work is introduced to scrutinize the systemic relationships among comments, users, and their interactions, thus enabling precise detection of offensive language patterns. Unlike traditional models, this framework considers not only the content of individual comments but also the intricate interconnections within the comments. Addressing this issueis essential not just for the well-being of users but can also give a few other advantages on social media platforms. A pre-trained transformer-based model approach is proposed for the classification of offensive language in code-mixed text. This proposed method attained an F 1-score with an overall accuracy of 67.07 \%.  © 2024 IEEE.},

In this paper, we combined various low-resource language datasets and propose MultiFED, a federated approach that performs effectively to detect hate speech. MultiFED utilizes continuous adaptation and fine-tuning to aid generalization using subsets of multilingual data overcoming the limitations of data scarcity. Extensive experiments are conducted on 13 Indic datasets across five different pre-trained models.

In this paper, we perform a large-scale transfer learning experiment aimed at discovering latent VL skills from data. We reveal interesting characteristics that have important implications for test suite design. First, generation tasks suffer from a length bias, suggesting benchmarks should balance tasks with varying output lengths. Second, we demonstrate that factor analysis successfully identifies reasonable yet surprising VL skill factors, suggesting benchmarks could leverage similar analyses for task selection. Finally, we present a new dataset, OLIVE, which simulates user instructions in the wild and presents challenges dissimilar to all datasets we tested.

	abstract = {Differences in bankruptcy regulations with varying value parameters cause data anomalies when implemented in the Altman Z-Score model. Another common problem in bankruptcy predictions is imbalanced data; the number of companies that fall into the bankruptcy category is much smaller than those that do not. Therefore, a novel method was proposed to address data imbalance and anomalies in an Altman Z-Score-based bankruptcy prediction model. The proposed method employs a two-step classification controlled with data binning. Assumption values were used to set the proportion of distress and non-distress classes. Quartile calculation-based data binning is then used to ordinally rank the non-distress category into three classes. Furthermore, a two-step classification was performed using the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) method, followed by a rule-based classification method. The LSTM method predicts output in the form of one class representing the distress zone and three classes representing non-distress zone subcategories. The results are then processed using a rule-based classification to summarize the output into a two-class classification, where all data not in the distress zone class is part of the non-distress zone. The performance evaluation shows promising results, with outcomes closely matching the source bankruptcy data. These findings strengthen the evidence that the Altman Z-Score is a powerful tool for bankruptcy prediction and demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the Altman Z-Score model in handling differences in data value parameters. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

In response to this, we introduce GalaxyGPT, a framework that synergizes safety moderation services of Internet vendors with LLMs to enhance safety performance. This necessity arises from the growing complexity of online interactions and the imperative to ensure that LLMs operate within safe and ethical boundaries without compromising their utility. GalaxyGPT leverages advanced algorithms and a comprehensive dataset to significantly improve safety measures, achieving notable accuracy (95.8%) and F1-score (94.5%) through evaluations of our custom dataset comprising 500 single-round safety tests, 100 multi-round dialogue tests, and 200 open-source tests. These results starkly outperform the safety metrics of APIs from six vendors (average 40.5% accuracy) and LLMs without GalaxyGPT integration (73% accuracy). Additionally, we contribute to the community by releasing an open-source test set of 600 entries and a compact classification model for security tasks, specifically designed to challenge and enhance the robustness of APIs, thereby facilitating the efficient deployment and application of GalaxyGPT in diverse environments.  © 2024 The Authors.},

In recent years, the popularity of social networking has provided a medium through which some users can engage in offensive and harmful online behavior. In this study, we investigate the ability of different LLMs, ranging from zero-shot and few-shot learning to fine-tuning. Our experiments show that LLMs can identify sexist and hateful online texts using zero-shot and few-shot approaches through information retrieval. Furthermore, it is found that the encoder-decodermodel called Zephyr achieves the best results with the fine-tuning approach, scoring 86.811% on the Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS) test-set and 57.453% on the Multilingual Detection of Hate Speech Against Immigrants and Women in Twitter (HatEval) test-set. Finally, it is confirmed that the evaluated models perform well in hate text detection, as they beat the best result in the HatEval task leaderboard. The error analysis shows that contextual learning had difficulty distinguishing between types of hate speech and figurative language.However, the fine-tuned approach tends to produce many false positives. © 2024 Tech Science Press.

Social media networks generate a substantial amount of unstructured data on the Internet each and every second. Many people are interested in understanding human psychology because of the abundance of data. Sentiment analysis is used, which determines if the person may have negative, positive, or neutral thoughts on an incident. Emotion detection, which determines a person's emotional state, is necessary in particular situations where the use of sentiment analysis is insufficient. Deep learning has become the most popular sentiment analysis and emotion recognition technique. However, the need for many tagged data to achieve better performances demonstrates a more effective strategy to overcome this restriction.

While most LLMs incorporate defense mechanisms to prevent the generation of harmful content, these safeguards can be easily bypassed with minimal prompt engineering. In this paper, we introduce the new Thoroughly Engineered Toxicity (TET) dataset, comprising manually crafted prompts designed to nullify the protective layers of such models. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate the pivotal role of TET in providing a rigorous benchmark for evaluation of toxicity awareness in several popular LLMs: it highlights the toxicity in the LLMs that might remain hidden when using normal prompts, thus revealing subtler issues in their behavior. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

This research study has conducted experiments with LaMini and Google Flan-T5 models to analyze the impact of CoT prompts and explanations in zero shot and few shot settings to enhance model interpretability. The analysis reveals that on average including target information in pipeline significantly improves model performance. There is also a considerable effect of adding the explanations into the pipeline, boosting accuracy. The research findings highlight the importance of context and structured prompts in improving model accuracy, highlighting the need for responsible development and deployment of hate speech detection systems in online environments. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A meme is social media content with which the creator tries to convey a certain idea in public via the internet. Each meme consists of typically an image and supporting text. Its message can be humorous and inspiring, but hilarious and offensive often targeting a specific audience. To address the potential harm such memes can cause, Artificial Intelligence researchers have proposed solutions to classify a meme automatically according to the sentiment, emotion, and intensity felt by the users. Recent models for meme analysis often adopt the Transformer architecture, which is known to perform well but computationally expensive. The present study aims to introduce a novel method by providing (1) deep contextual information and (2) reducing resource utilization while keeping its efficiency. For the former, GPT-4 has been utilized to provide meaningful insights regarding the context behind the meme. For the latter, we extract Keyphrases and forward them to a U-net Encapsulated Transformer, called UET, to process the information. Extensive evaluation with ablation study using three standard meme datasets, i.e. Memotions, suggests that it outperforms state-of-the-art models on sentiment analysis, while it shows comparable performance on the emotion and intensity task. As the proposed model is more lightweight than a standard one and yet shows high performance, it provides new insights into meme analysis and could be useful for other Natural Language Processing tasks.  © 2024 The Authors.},

	abstract = {In recent years, social media has significantly influenced how we share information and exchange messages. However, a significant issue arises from the fast dissemination of deceptive information portrayed as legitimate, which may seriously affect both people and society. Identifying unmonitored 'deceptive text' has become a crucial concern in mainstream media due to its potentially damaging impact. Although there have been recent studies that have developed AI models capable of identifying deceptive text in other languages, there is a scarcity of research focused on detecting detective text specifically in the Arabic language. This paper presents a novel Arabic deceptive text detection dataset constructed from publicly available resources. The dataset offers a unique distinction between formal and informal text genres, reflecting the diverse communication styles encountered in real-world deceptive language. We evaluate the performance of various machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and transformer-based models on this dataset for classifying text as deceptive or non-deceptive. The study investigates the impact of incorporating additional textual features including morphological features, psycholinguistic features, and sociolinguistic features alongside the raw text data. Our findings demonstrate that the AraBERTv2 model, after fine-tuning the Arabic dataset and incorporating textual features, achieves the best classification performance. This research contributes a valuable resource for Arabic deceptive text analysis and highlights the effectiveness of fine-tuned AraBERTv2 models with enriched features for such tasks.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the realm of text manipulation and linguistic transformation, the question of authorship has been a subject of fascination and philosophical inquiry. Much like the Ship of Theseus paradox, which ponders whether a ship remains the same when each of its original planks is replaced, our research delves into an intriguing question: Does a text retain its original authorship when it undergoes numerous paraphrasing iterations? Specifically, since Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in both the generation of original content and the modification of human-authored texts, a pivotal question emerges concerning the determination of authorship in instances where LLMs or similar paraphrasing tools are employed to rephrase the text-i.e., whether authorship should be attributed to the original human author or the AI-powered tool. Therefore, we embark on a philosophical voyage through the seas of language and authorship to unravel this intricate puzzle. Using a computational approach, we discover that the diminishing performance in text classification models, with each successive paraphrasing iteration, is closely associated with the extent of deviation from the original author's style, thus provoking a reconsideration of the current notion of authorship. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

However, this shift has also exposed the dark side of online interactions, including gambling and offensive comments, detracting from the experience of regular viewers. To address this, we present BScFilter, a pioneering Deep Learning approach for filtering sports comments in a resource-constrained environment. Our aim is to create a supportive viewer environment by automatically detecting and categorizing comments as gamble, hate, or sports-related. Leveraging our own developed dataset of 6012 annotated Bengali sports comments, we explore a range of ML and DL algorithms. The hybrid CNN+BiLSTM model with Keras embedding emerges as the top performer, achieving an impressive F1-score of 96.87%. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses, revealing the strengths and limitations of our approach. While displaying promising outcomes, BScFilter offers an effective remedy to cultivate a respectful digital atmosphere for sports lovers, attenuating the influence of detrimental comments. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

	abstract = {Many applications of large language models (LLMs), ranging from chatbots to creative writing, require nuanced subjective judgments that can differ significantly across different groups. Existing alignment algorithms can be expensive to align for each group, requiring prohibitive amounts of group-specific preference data and computation for real-world use cases. We introduce Group Preference Optimization (GPO), an alignment framework that steers language models to preferences of individual groups in a few-shot manner. In GPO, we augment the base LLM with an independent transformer module trained to predict the preferences of a group for the LLM generations. For few-shot learning, we parameterize this module as an in-context autoregressive transformer and train it via meta-learning on several groups. We empirically validate the efficacy of GPO through rigorous evaluations using LLMs with varied sizes on three human opinion adaptation tasks. These tasks involve adapting to the preferences of US demographic groups, global countries, and individual users. Our results demonstrate that GPO not only aligns models more accurately but also requires fewer group-specific preferences, and less training and inference computing resources, outperforming existing strategies such as in-context steering and fine-tuning methods. © 2024 12th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2024.
