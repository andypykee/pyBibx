Title = {Hate speech detection: A comprehensive review of recent works},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {41},
Number = {8, SI},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {There has been surge in the usage of Internet as well as social media
   platforms which has led to rise in online hate speech targeted on
   individual or group. In the recent years, hate speech has resulted in
   one of the challenging problems that can unfurl at a fast pace on
   digital platforms leading to various issues such as prejudice, violence
   and even genocide. Considering the acceptance of Artificial Intelligence
   (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in varied
   application domains, it would be intriguing to consider these techniques
   for automated hate speech detection. In literature, there have been
   efforts to recognize and categorize hate speech using varied Machine
   Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. Hence, considering the
   need and provocations for hate speech detection we aim to present a
   comprehensive review that discusses fundamental taxonomy as well as
   recent advances in the field of online hate speech identification. There
   is a significant amount of literature related to the initial phases of
   hate speech detection. The background section provides a detailed
   explanation of the previous research. The subsequent section that
   follows is dedicated to examining the recent literature published from
   the year 2020 onwards. The paper presents some of the hate speech
   datasets considered for hate speech detection. Furthermore, the paper
   discusses different data modalities, namely, textual hate speech
   detection, multi-modal hate speech detection and multilingual hate
   speech detection. Apart from systematic review on hate speech detection,
   the paper also implement several multi-label models to compare the
   performance of hate speech detection by employing classic ML technique
   namely, Logistic Regression and DL technique namely, Long Short-Term
   Memory (LSTM) and a multiclass multi-label architecture. In the
   implemented architecture, we have derived two new elements to quantify
   the hatefulness and intensity of hatred to improve the results for hate
   speech detection using Indonesian tweet dataset. Empirical Analysis of
   the model reveals that the implemented approach outperforms and is able
   to achieve improved results for the underlying dataset.},

Abstract = {With the continuous growth of internet users and media content, it is
   very hard to track down hateful speech in audio and video. Converting
   video or audio into text does not detect hate speech accurately as human
   sometimes uses hateful words as humorous or pleasant in sense and also
   uses different voice tones or show different action in the video. The
   state-of-the-art hate speech detection models were mostly developed on a
   single modality. In this research, a combined approach of multi-modal
   system has been proposed to detect hate speech from video contents by
   extracting feature images, feature values extracted from the audio, text
   and used machine learning and Natural language processing.},

Abstract = {Hate speech against individuals or communities with different
   backgrounds is a major problem in online social networks. The domain of
   hate speech has spread to various topics, including race, religion, and
   gender. Although there are many efforts for hate speech detection in
   different domains and languages, the effects of gender identity are not
   solely examined in hate speech detection. Moreover, hate speech
   detection is mostly studied for particular languages, specifically
   English, but not low-resource languages, such as Turkish. We examine
   gender identity-based hate speech detection for both English and Turkish
   tweets. We compare the performances of state-of-the-art models using 20
   k tweets per language. We observe that transformer-based language models
   outperform bag-of-words and deep learning models, while the conventional
   bag-of-words model has surprising performances, possibly due to
   offensive or hate-related keywords. Furthermore, we analyze the effect
   of debiased embeddings for hate speech detection. We find that the
   performance can be improved by removing the gender-related bias in
   neural embeddings since gender-biased words can have offensive or
   hateful implications.},

Abstract = {With the increasing use of social media with its ability for users to
   share comments immediately, the extent of a system to identify offensive
   content has become a necessity in all languages. Due to the lack of
   publicly available resources on offensive language identification for
   Farsi, which has more than 110 million speakers, we present Pars-OFF, a
   three-layered annotated corpus for offensive language detection in Farsi
   to fill the existing gap. The introduced corpus contains 10,563 data
   samples. The tweets have been collected with a combination of
   similarity-based and keyword-based data selection techniques to avoid
   severe unbalancedness. Additionally, as a baseline, this article reports
   the performance of the traditional machine learning approaches and
   Transformer based models over the Pars-OFF dataset. The best performance
   was obtained by the BERT+fastText model, yielding the F1-Macro score of
   89.57.},

Abstract = {Automated hate speech detection in social media is a challenging task
   that has recently gained significant traction in the data mining and
   Natural Language Processing community. However, most of the existing
   methods adopt a supervised approach that depended heavily on the
   annotated hate speech datasets, which are imbalanced and often lack
   training samples for hateful content. This paper addresses the research
   gaps by proposing a novel multitask learning-based model, AngryBERT,
   which jointly learns hate speech detection with sentiment classification
   and target identification as secondary relevant tasks. We conduct
   extensive experiments to augment three commonly-used hate speech
   detection datasets. Our experiment results show that AngryBERT
   outperforms state-of-the-art single-task-learning and multitask learning
   baselines. We conduct ablation studies and case studies to empirically
   examine the strengths and characteristics of our AngryBERT model and
   show that the secondary tasks are able to improve hate speech detection.},

Abstract = {Hate speech detection has been the subject of high research attention,
   due to the scale of content created on social media. In spite of the
   attention and the sensitive nature of the task, privacy preservation in
   hate speech detection has remained under-studied. The majority of
   research has focused on centralised machine learning infrastructures
   which risk leaking data. In this paper, we show that using federated
   machine learning can help address privacy the concerns that are inherent
   to hate speech detection while obtaining up to 6.81\% improvement in
   terms of F1-score.},

Abstract = {Detecting hate speech on social media poses a significant challenge,
   especially in distinguishing it from offensive language, as
   learning-based models often struggle due to nuanced differences between
   them, which leads to frequent misclassifications of hate speech
   instances, with most research focusing on refining hate speech detection
   methods. Thus, this paper seeks to know if traditional learning-based
   methods should still be used, considering the perceived advantages of
   deep learning in this domain. This is done by investigating advancements
   in hate speech detection. It involves the utilization of deep
   learning-based models for detailed hate speech detection tasks and
   compares the results with those obtained from traditional learning-based
   baseline models through multidimensional aspect analysis. By considering
   various aspects to gain a comprehensive understanding, we can discern
   the strengths and weaknesses in current state-of-the-art techniques. Our
   research findings reveal the performance of traditional learning-based
   hate speech detection outperforms that of deep learning-based methods.
   While acknowledging the potential demonstrated by deep learning
   methodologies, this study emphasizes the significance of traditional
   machine learning approaches in effectively addressing hate speech
   detection tasks. It advocates for a balanced perspective, highlighting
   that dismissing the capabilities of traditional methods in favor of
   emerging deep learning-based techniques may not consistently yield the
   most effective results.},

Abstract = {Due to the severity of the social media offensive and hateful comments
   in Brazil, and the lack of research in Portuguese, this paper provides
   the first large-scale expert annotated corpus of Brazilian Instagram
   comments for hate speech and offensive language detection. The HateBR
   corpus was collected from the comment section of Brazilian politicians'
   accounts on Instagram and manually annotated by specialists, reaching a
   high inter-annotator agreement. The corpus consists of 7,000 documents
   annotated according to three different layers: a binary classification
   (offensive versus non-offensive comments), offensiveness-level
   classification (highly, moderately, and slightly offensive), and nine
   hate speech groups (xenophobia, racism, homophobia, sexism, religious
   intolerance, partyism, apology for the dictatorship, antisemitism, and
   fatphobia). We also implemented baseline experiments for offensive
   language and hate speech detection and compared them with a literature
   baseline. Results show that the baseline experiments on our corpus
   outperform the current state-of-the-art for the Portuguese language.},

Abstract = {Online hate speech is an important issue that breaks the cohesiveness of
   online social communities and even raises public safety concerns in our
   societies. Motivated by this rising issue, researchers have developed
   many traditional machine learning and deep learning methods to detect
   hate speech in online social platforms automatically. However, most of
   these methods have only considered single type textual feature, e.g.,
   term frequency, or using word embeddings. Such approaches neglect the
   other rich textual information that could be utilized to improve hate
   speech detection. In this paper, we propose DeepHate, a novel deep
   learning model that combines multi-faceted text representations such as
   word embeddings, sentiments, and topical information, to detect hate
   speech in online social platforms. We conduct extensive experiments and
   evaluate DeepHate on three large publicly available real-world datasets.
   Our experiment results show that DeepHate outperforms the
   state-of-the-art baselines on the hate speech detection task. We also
   perform case studies to provide insights into the salient features that
   best aid in detecting hate speech in online social platforms.},

Abstract = {Automated hate speech detection is an important tool in combating the
   spread of hate speech, particularly in social media. Numerous methods
   have been developed for the task, including a recent proliferation of
   deep-learning based approaches. A variety of datasets have also been
   developed, exemplifying various manifestations of the hate-speech
   detection problem. We present here a large-scale empirical comparison of
   deep and shallow hate-speech detection methods, mediated through the
   three most commonly used datasets. Our goal is to illuminate progress in
   the area, and identify strengths and weaknesses in the current
   state-of-the-art. We particularly focus our analysis on measures of
   practical performance, including detection effectiveness, computational
   efficiency, capability in using pre-trained models, and domain
   generalization. In doing so we aim to provide guidance as to the use of
   hate-speech detection in practice, quantify the state-of-the-art, and
   identify future research directions.},

Abstract = {We study the selection of transfer languages for automatic abusive
   language detection. Instead of preparing a dataset for every language,
   we demonstrate the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer learning for
   zero-shot abusive language detection. This way we can use existing data
   from higher-resource languages to build better detection systems for
   low-resource languages. Our datasets are from seven different languages
   from three language families. We measure the distance between the
   languages using several language similarity measures, especially by
   quantifying the World Atlas of Language Structures. We show that there
   is a correlation between linguistic similarity and classifier
   performance. This discovery allows us to choose an optimal transfer
   language for zero shot abusive language detection.},

Abstract = {The rise of emergence of social media platforms has fundamentally
   altered how people communicate, and among the results of these
   developments is an increase in online use of abusive content. Therefore,
   automatically detecting this content is essential for banning
   inappropriate information, and reducing toxicity and violence on social
   media platforms. The existing works on hate speech and offensive
   language detection produce promising results based on pre-trained
   transformer models, however, they considered only the analysis of
   abusive content features generated through annotated datasets. This
   paper addresses a multi-task joint learning approach which combines
   external emotional features extracted from another corpora in dealing
   with the imbalanced and scarcity of labeled datasets. Our analysis are
   using two well-known Transformer-based models, BERT and mBERT, where the
   later is used to address abusive content detection in multi-lingual
   scenarios. Our model jointly learns abusive content detection with
   emotional features by sharing representations through transformers'
   shared encoder. This approach increases data efficiency, reduce
   overfitting via shared representations, and ensure fast learning by
   leveraging auxiliary information. Our findings demonstrate that
   emotional knowledge helps to more reliably identify hate speech and
   offensive language across datasets. Our hate speech detection Multi-task
   model exhibited 3\% performance improvement over baseline models, but
   the performance of multi-task models were not significant for offensive
   language detection task. More interestingly, in both tasks, multi-task
   models exhibits less false positive errors compared to single task
   scenario.},

Title = {Measuring and mitigating language model biases in abusive language
   detection},
Journal = {INFORMATION PROCESSING \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {60},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Warning: This paper contains abusive samples that may cause discomfort
   to readers.Abusive language on social media reinforces prejudice against
   an individual or a specific group of people, which greatly hampers
   freedom of expression. With the rise of large-scale pre-trained language
   models, classification based on pre-trained language models has
   gradually become a paradigm for automatic abusive language detection.
   However, the effect of stereotypes inherent in language models on the
   detection of abusive language remains unknown, although this may further
   reinforce biases against the minorities. To this end, in this paper, we
   use multiple metrics to measure the presence of bias in language models
   and analyze the impact of these inherent biases in automatic abusive
   language detection. On the basis of this quantitative analysis, we
   propose two different debiasing strategies, token debiasing and sentence
   debiasing, which are jointly applied to reduce the bias of language
   models in abusive language detection without degrading the
   classification performance. Specifically, for the token debiasing
   strategy, we reduce the discrimination of the language model against
   protected attribute terms of a certain group by random probability
   estimation. For the sentence debiasing strategy, we replace protected
   attribute terms and augment the original text by counterfactual
   augmentation to obtain debiased samples, and use the consistency
   regularization between the original data and the augmented samples to
   eliminate the bias at the sentence level of the language model. The
   experimental results confirm that our method can not only reduce the
   bias of the language model in the abusive language detection task, but
   also effectively improve the performance of abusive language detection.},

Abstract = {Scarcity of large-scale datasets, especially for resource-impoverished
   languages encouraged exploration of data-efficient methods for hate
   speech detection. In this work, we progress implicit and explicit hate
   speech detection using an input-level data augmentation technique, task
   reformulation using entailment and cross-learning across five languages.
   Our proposed data augmentation technique EasyMixup, improves the F1
   performance across languages by 0.5-9\%. We also observe substantial F1
   gains of 1-8\% by reformulating hate speech detection as
   Entailment-style problem. We further probe the contextual models and
   observe that higher layers encode implicit hate while lower layers focus
   on explicit hate, highlighting the importance of token-level
   understanding for explicit and context-level for implicit hate speech
   detection. (1)},

Abstract = {Avoiding to rely on dataset artifacts to predict hate speech is at the
   cornerstone of robust and fair hate speech detection. In this paper we
   critically analyze lexical biases in hate speech detection via a
   cross-platform study, disentangling various types of spurious and
   authentic artifacts and analyzing their impact on out-of-distribution
   fairness and robustness. We experiment with existing approaches and
   propose simple yet surprisingly effective data-centric baselines. Our
   results on English data across four platforms show that distinct
   spurious artifacts require different treatments to ultimately attain
   both robustness and fairness in hate speech detection. To encourage
   research in this direction, we release all baseline models and the code
   to compute artifacts, pointing it out as a complementary and necessary
   addition to the data statements practice.(1)},

   community. Machine learning models have been proposed to detect hate
   speech in social media; however, several issues presently limit the
   performance of current approaches. One challenge is the issue of having
   diverse comprehensions of hate speech constructs which will lead to many
   speech categories and different interpretations. In addition, certain
   language-specific features, and short text issues, such as Twitter,
   exacerbate the problem. Moreover, current machine learning approaches
   lack universality due to small datasets and the adoption of a few
   features of hateful speech. This paper develops and builds new feature
   sets based on frequencies of textual tokens and psychological
   characteristics. Then, the study evaluates several machine learning
   methods over a large dataset. Results showed that the Random Forest and
   BERT methods are the most valuable for detecting hate speech content.
   Furthermore, the most dominant features that are helpful for hate speech
   detection methods combine psychological features and Term-Frequency
   Inverse Document-Frequency (TFIDF) features. Therefore, the proposed
   approach could identify hate speech on social media platforms like
   Twitter.},

   state-of-the-art performance across various NLP tasks including the
   identification of offensive language and hate speech, an important
   problem in social media. In this paper, we present fBERT, a BERT model
   retrained on SOLID, the largest English offensive language
   identification corpus available with over 1:4 million offensive
   instances. We evaluate fBERT's performance on identifying offensive
   content on multiple English datasets and we test several thresholds for
   selecting instances from SOLID. The fBERT model will be made freely

Abstract = {Nowadays, hate speech detection from Arabic tweets attracts the
   attention of many researchers. Numerous systems and techniques have been
   proposed to address this classification challenge. Nonetheless, three
   major limits persist: the use of deep learning models with an excess of
   hyperparameters, the reliance on hand-crafted features, and the
   requirement for a huge amount of training data to achieve satisfactory
   performance. In this study, we propose Contextual Deep Random Forest
   (CDRF), a hate speech detection approach that combines contextual
   embedding and Deep Random Forest. From the experimental findings, the
   Arabic contextual embedding model proves to be highly effective in hate
   speech detection, outperforming the static embedding models.
   Additionally, we prove that the proposed CDRF significantly enhances the
   performance of Arabic hate speech classification.},

Abstract = {As the harms of online toxic language become more apparent, countering
   online toxic behavior is an essential application of natural language
   processing. The first step in managing toxic language risk is
   identification, but algorithmic approaches have themselves demonstrated
   bias. Texts containing some demographic identity terms such as gay or
   Black are more likely to be labeled as toxic in existing toxic language
   detection datasets. In many machine learning models introduced for toxic
   language detection, non-toxic comments containing minority and
   marginalized community-specific identity terms were given unreasonably
   high toxicity scores. To address the challenge of bias in toxic language
   detection, we propose a two-step training approach. A pretrained
   language model with a multitask learning objective will mitigate biases
   in the toxicity classifier prediction. Experiments demonstrate that
   jointly training the pretrained language model with a multitask
   objective can effectively mitigate the impacts of unintended biases and
   is more robust to model bias towards commonly-attacked identity groups
   presented in datasets without significantly hurting the model's
   generalizability.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, there is a growing connection among individuals promoted by
   the Internet, which provides opportunities for expressing their
   viewpoints through social media platforms. However, this expanded
   freedom of expression has been susceptible to the propagation of hate
   speech, a phenomenon that can precipitate unlawful conduct and
   potentially engender detrimental psychological ramifications. In
   response, computational technology has emerged as a valuable tool for
   identifying and mitigating hate speech on social media. In this chapter,
   we used five datasets to detect hate speech related to politics on
   social media. These datasets encompass the English, Italian, Filipino,
   German, and Turkish languages. In pursuit of hate speech detection, our
   study advocates adopting a Pre-Trained Language Model (PTLM) with
   Cross-Lingual Learning (CLL). We tried to detect hate speech in two
   languages (English and Italian) using English BERT and Italian BERT. We
   used Zero-Shot (ZST), Joint Learning (JL), Cascade Learning (CL), JL/CL,
   and CL/JL+ approaches. These techniques demonstrated efficacy in
   detecting hate speech. We obtained 94.8\% in the F-score metric using
   English BERT and 93\% using Italian BERT.},

Abstract = {Modern toxic speech detectors are incompetent in recognizing disguised
   offensive language, such as adversarial attacks that deliberately avoid
   known toxic lexicons, or manifestations of implicit bias. Building a
   large annotated dataset for such veiled toxicity can be very expensive.
   In this work, we propose a framework aimed at fortifying existing toxic
   speech detectors without a large labeled corpus of veiled toxicity. Just
   a handful of probing examples are used to surface orders of magnitude
   more disguised offenses. We augment the toxic speech detector's training
   data with these discovered offensive examples, thereby making it more
   robust to veiled toxicity while preserving its utility in detecting
   overt toxicity.(1)
   Warning: this paper contains examples that may be offensive or
   upsetting.},

Abstract = {We present the results of HASOC-Dravidian-CodeMix shared task1 held at
   FIRE 2021, a track on offensive language identification for Dravidian
   languages in Code-Mixed Text in this paper. This paper will detail the
   task, its organisation, and the submitted systems. The identification of
   offensive language was viewed as a classification task. For this, 16
   teams participated in identifying offensive language from Tamil-English
   code mixed data, 11 teams for Malayalam-English code mixed data and 14
   teams for Tamil data. The teams detected offensive language using
   various machine learning and deep learning classification models. This
   paper has analysed those benchmark systems to find out how well they
   accommodate a code-mixed scenario in Dravidian languages, focusing on
   Tamil and Malayalam.},

Abstract = {Social media has become a constant in our everyday life. However, its
   steady growth has increased the hate speech and hostile content problem.
   To curb this, hate speech detection and recognition is required, but it
   is faced to two major challenges - laws and enforcement, and automatic
   computerized hate speech detection. Although many studies are already
   implemented in detecting hate content, many of these are done in a
   single setting showing a single dataset in comparison to machine
   learning or deep learning models. Thus, there is no comparison between
   previous approaches and recent inventions such as transformer model.
   Therefore, in this work we explored and compared recent advanced
   approaches in automatic hate speech detection. Our aim is to analyze the
   influence different approaches in detecting hate content and its
   applicability in the real world. Several experiments were conducted on
   eight real hate speech datasets from recent studies. We present the
   results of each comparison which shows that the recent transformer model
   approach is able to outmatch many of the previous hate speech
   recognition models by significant G-Means and F1 scores.
   To the author's knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to present a
   large comparative study of approaches in hate speech detection.},

Abstract = {Social media has revolutionized the manner in which our society is
   interconnected. While this extensive connectivity offers numerous
   benefits, it is also accompanied by significant drawbacks, particularly
   in terms of the proliferation of fake news and the vast dissemination of
   hate speech. Identifying offensive comments is a critical task for
   ensuring the safety of users, which is why industry and academia have
   been working on developing solutions to this problem. Prior research on
   hate speech detection has predominantly focused on the English language,
   with few studies devoted to other languages such as Portuguese. This
   paper introduces the Offensive Language Identification Dataset for
   Brazilian Portuguese (OLID-BR), a high-quality NLP dataset for offensive
   language detection, which we make publicly available. The dataset
   contains 6,354 (extendable to 13,538) comments labeled using a
   fine-grained three-layer annotation schema compatible with datasets in
   other languages, which allows the training of multilingual/cross-lingual
   models. The five NLP tasks available in OLID-BR allow the detection of
   offensive comments, the classification of the types of offenses such as
   racism, LGBTQphobia, sexism, xenophobia, and so on, the identification
   of the type and the target of offensive comments, and the extraction of
   toxic spans of offensive comments. All those tasks can enhance the
   capabilities of content moderation systems by providing deep contextual
   analysis or highlighting the spans that make a text toxic. We further
   experiment with and evaluate the dataset using state-of-the-art
   BERT-based and NER models, which demonstrates the usefulness of OLID-BR
   for the development of toxicity detection systems for Portuguese texts.},

Abstract = {Along with the increasing activity on social media, hate speech is
   getting out of control. Hate speech detection can be done by utilizing
   text mining technology. There have been many hate speech detection
   studies conducted. To identify and analyze research trends, data
   sources, methods and features used in hate speech detection, this
   systematic literature review was created. Until early 2020, the topics
   of hate speech were found, including hate speech against minorities,
   religion, women, the general election agenda, and politics. Sources of
   data that are widely used to be used as datasets come from twitter. Hate
   speech is not only classified into HS (hate speech) and Non-HS (non-hate
   speech) but can be further classified into racism, sexism, offensive,
   abusive, threats of violence and others. Of the 38 studies that meet
   inclusion and exclusion, there are 26 algorithms and 28 features that
   have been used to detect hate speech. However, these methods and
   features do not necessarily guarantee a good hate detection performance.
   Hate speech classification performance is also influenced by the
   dataset, the features chosen, the number of classes and mutually
   exclusive classes.},

Abstract = {In this work we target the problem of hate speech detection in
   multimodal publications formed by a text and an image. We gather and
   annotate a large scale dataset from Twitter, MMHS150K, and propose
   different models that jointly analyze textual and visual information for
   hate speech detection, comparing them with unimodal detection. We
   provide quantitative and qualitative results and analyze the challenges
   of the proposed task. We find that, even though images are useful for
   the hate speech detection task, current multimodal models cannot
   outperform models analyzing only text. We discuss why and open the field
   and the dataset for further research.},

Abstract = {The detection of hate speech on online platforms is essential for
   maintaining safe and inclusive digital environments. Although
   significant progress has been made in binary classification for hate
   speech detection, challenges persist in multilingual and fine-grained
   classification. This study presents a comprehensive model for hate
   speech detection across English, Urdu, and Sindhi, utilizing advanced
   deep learning models like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
   Transformers (BERT) and its multilingual variants. Additionally, the
   research employs Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques,
   such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), to gain
   insights into model performance. This work curated a multilingual hate
   speech detection dataset and a robust fine-grained hate speech detection
   model. The dataset includes non-hate and hate speech classes.
   Furthermore, the hate speech class is categorized into five fine-grained
   categories, including Disability, Gender, Nationality, Race, and
   Religion. The experimental findings of this study showed 91\% F-score in
   binary class classification and 86\% weighted F-score in fine-grained
   hate speech detection for multilingual datasets using XLM-RoBERTa
   technique. Notably, the Religion class achieved the highest F-score of
   92\%. It is believed that this study contributes to reducing the spread
   of hate speech (written in Either Urdu, English, or Sindhi) on various
   social media platforms.},

Abstract = {Most of research on the identification of offensive speech on social
   media platforms exist in English and other rich languages. A series of
   recently proposed methods for detecting low resource offensive languages
   require labeled data. In this work, we propose an unsupervised model
   that can detect offensive speech for low-resource languages. Our method
   does not depend on any labeled data of low-resource languages. In
   detail, we propose an agreement regularized training that combines
   adversarial learning and transfer learning. Augmenting low-resource
   training data with sample regeneration methods to maintain the
   performance of the trained offensive speech identification model from
   rich-resource to low-resource languages. Extensive experiments on four
   low-resource languages demonstrate that our model either is on par or
   outperforms the supervised methods, without employing any annotated data
   on real-world offensive speech detection tasks for low-resource
   languages.},

Abstract = {Hate speech detection is a process of recognition of communication media
   such as text, audio, and/or video, if it contains hatred and/or
   encourages violence towards a person or a community of people. This is
   usually based on prejudice against `protected characteristics' such as
   their ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age and so on.
   Complex and sophisticated classifiers based hate speech detection
   systems are available in the literature. However, the characteristics
   exhibited by explainable artificial intelligence techniques demonstrated
   versatile capabilities. This potential is due to the complex classifiers
   presenting themselves as black-box in nature hence limiting the social
   acceptability and usability of the developed systems. In this study,
   video datasets for English and Kiswahili languages were manually
   collected from YouTube, converted to audio, and used to detect hate
   speech. Ensemble based classification algorithms have been used for
   implementation of hate speech detection system. Random Forest classifier
   recorded an accuracy of 95.8\% for English language while for Kiswahili
   language, Extreme Gradient Boosting classifier achieved an accuracy of
   91.8\%. To explain the results achieved by these classifiers, in terms
   of how specific audio-based features contributed to the overall
   detection of hate speech, SHapley Additive exPlanations technique (SHAP)
   is used.},

Title = {Vulnerable community identification using hate speech detection on
   social media},
Journal = {INFORMATION PROCESSING \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {57},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {With the rapid development in mobile computing and Web technologies,
   online hate speech has been increasingly spread in social network
   platforms since its easy to post any opinions. Previous studies confirm
   that exposure to online hate speech has serious offline consequences to
   historically deprived communities. Thus, research on automated hate
   speech detection has attracted much attention. However, the role of
   social networks in identifying hate-related vulnerable community is not
   well investigated. Hate speech can affect all population groups, but
   some are more vulnerable to its impact than others. For example, for
   ethnic groups whose languages have few computational resources, it is a
   challenge to automatically collect and process online texts, not to
   mention automatic hate speech detection on social media. In this paper,
   we propose a hate speech detection approach to identify hatred against
   vulnerable minority groups on social media. Firstly, in Spark
   distributed processing framework, posts are automatically collected and
   pre-processed, and features are extracted using word n-grams and word
   embedding techniques such as Word2Vec. Secondly, deep learning
   algorithms for classification such as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a
   variety of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), are used for hate speech
   detection. Finally, hate words are clustered with methods such as
   Word2Vec to predict the potential target ethnic group for hatred. In our
   experiments, we use Amharic language in Ethiopia as an example. Since
   there was no publicly available dataset for Amharic texts, we crawled
   Facebook pages to prepare the corpus. Since data annotation could be
   biased by culture, we recruit annotators from different cultural
   backgrounds and achieved better inter-annotator agreement. In our
   experimental results, feature extraction using word embedding techniques
   such as Word2Vec performs better in both classical and deep
   learning-based classification algorithms for hate speech detection,
   among which GRU achieves the best result. Our proposed approach can
   successfully identify the Tigre ethnic group as the highly vulnerable
   community in terms of hatred compared with Amhara and Oromo. As a
   result, hatred vulnerable group identification is vital to protect them
   by applying automatic hate speech detection model to remove contents
   that aggravate psychological harm and physical conflicts. This can also
   encourage the way towards the development of policies, strategies, and
   tools to empower and protect vulnerable communities.},

Title = {BERT-based Approach to Arabic Hate Speech and Offensive Language
   Detection in Twitter: Exploiting Emojis and Sentiment Analysis},

Abstract = {The user-generated content on the internet including that on social
   media may contain offensive language and hate speech which negatively
   affect the mental health of the whole internet society and may lead to
   hate crimes. Intelligent models for automatic detection of offensive
   language and hate speech have attracted significant attention recently.
   In this paper, we propose an automatic method for detecting offensive
   language and fine-grained hate speech from Arabic tweets. We compare
   between BERT and two conventional machine learning techniques (SVM,
   logistic regression). We also investigate the use of sentiment analysis
   and emojis descriptions as appending features along with the textual
   content of the tweets. The experiments shows that BERT-based model gives
   the best results, surpassing the best benchmark systems in the
   literature, on all three tasks: (a) offensive language detection with
   84.3\% F1-score, (b) hate speech detection with 81.8\% F1-score, and (c)
   fine-grained hate-speech recognition (e.g., race, religion, social
   class, etc.) with 45.1\% F1-score. The use of sentiment analysis
   slightly improves the performance of the models when detecting offensive
   language and hate speech but has no positive effect on the performance
   of the models when recognising the type of the hate speech. The use of
   textual emoji description as features can improve or deteriorate the
   performance of the models depending on the size of the examples per
   class and whether the emojis are considered among distinctive features
   between classes or not.},

Abstract = {Online social media is a very popular platform nowadays where people can
   easily make virtual connections with each other and can freely express
   their opinions and interests on various topics over time. The ability to
   freely express oneself often results in the spread of hate speech in the
   virtual world. Thus, it is very important to detect automatically hate
   speech to reduce its spread on social media. Most of the existing
   research works in this area paid less attention to the topical hate
   speech detection. In this paper, we addressed topic-oriented hate speech
   detection using machine learning classifiers. Experimental results on a
   real dataset demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model.},

Abstract = {Due to the growth of hate speech on social media in recent years, it is
   important to understand this issue. An automatic hate speech detection
   system is needed to help to counter this problem. There have been many
   studies on detecting hate speech in short documents like Twitter data.
   But to our knowledge, research on long documents is rare, we suppose
   that the difficulty is increasing due to the possibility of the message
   of the text may be hidden. In this research, we explore in detecting
   hate speech on Indonesian long documents using machine learning
   approach. We build a new Indonesian hate speech dataset from Facebook.
   The experiment showed that the best performance obtained by Support
   Vector Machine (SVM) as its classifier algorithm using TF-IDF, char
   quad-gram, word unigram, and lexicon features that yield f1-score of
   85\%.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel approach to detecting hate speech on
   Twitter. Our method incorporates textual, social context and language
   features of the author to better capture the nuances of hate speech and
   improve detection accuracy. We formalize the idea that an individual's
   hateful content is influenced by their social circle and propose a
   framework that combines text content with social context to detect hate
   speech. Our framework uses a Variational Graph Auto-encoder to jointly
   learn the unified features of authors using a social network, language
   features, and profile information. Additionally, to accommodate emerging
   and future language models, our framework is designed to be flexible and
   can incorporate any text encoder as a plug-in to obtain the textual
   features of the content. We evaluate our method on two diverse Twitter
   datasets and show that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
   by a significant margin. Our results suggest that considering social
   context is a promising direction for improving hate speech detection on
   Twitter.},

Abstract = {Abusive language online has become a growing social issue in our age of
   social media. Given the massive amounts of data being generated daily on
   social platforms, manually detecting and regulating such behavior has
   become unfeasible, so automatic solutions are necessary, and tasks
   related to identifying abusive language, in its various forms, from hate
   speech to bullying, have come into the focus of the natural language
   processing research community. In this paper, we focus on two subtypes
   of abusive language: aggressive language and offensive language, for
   which we implement a deep learning model based on convolutional neural
   networks. We further propose a new approach using transfer learning to
   boost performance of abusive language detection by leveraging data
   annotated with a different type of label, related to sentiment. We show
   how transferring knowledge between these tasks affects performance of
   detecting abusive language, offering insights into how these tasks are
   related, and how the more traditional task of sentiment analysis can be
   leveraged to help with solving the newer and less data rich task of
   abusive language detection.},

Abstract = {Most hate speech detection research focuses on a single language,
   generally English, which limits their generalisability to other
   languages. In this paper we investigate the cross-lingual hate speech
   detection task, tackling the problem by adapting the hate speech
   resources from one language to another. We propose a cross-lingual
   capsule network learning model coupled with extra domain-specific
   lexical semantics for hate speech (CCNL-Ex). Our model achieves
   state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets from AMI@Evalita2018
   and AMI@Ibereval2018 involving three languages: English, Spanish and
   Italian, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on all six language

Abstract = {The Arabic language is spoken by a wide range of countries across Asia,
   however, it is a low-resource language that has a minimal number of
   linguistic resources. Moreover, the large spread of Arabic speakers
   spans several countries and cultures, which creates a complex variation
   in its dialectal form. This variation makes it very challenging to
   analyze online Arabic content, particularly for offensive language
   detection. We propose a transfer learning approach for dialectal Arabic
   offensives language detection based on the BERT model. The results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in improving the
   performance of some Arabic dialects, such as the Tunisian and the
   Egyptian.},

Abstract = {The development of computational methods to detect abusive language in
   social media within variable and multilingual contexts has recently
   gained significant traction. The growing interest is confirmed by the
   large number of benchmark corpora for different languages developed in
   the latest years. However, abusive language behaviour is multifaceted
   and available datasets are featured by different topical focuses. This
   makes abusive language detection a domain-dependent task, and building a
   robust system to detect general abusive content a first challenge.
   Moreover, most resources are available for English, which makes
   detecting abusive language in low-resource languages a further
   challenge. We address both challenges by considering ten publicly
   available datasets across different domains and languages. A hybrid
   approach with deep learning and a multilingual lexicon to cross-domain
   and cross-lingual detection of abusive content is proposed and compared
   with other simpler models. We show that training a system on general
   abusive language datasets will produce a cross-domain robust system,
   which can be used to detect other more specific types of abusive
   content. We also found that using the domain-independent lexicon HurtLex
   is useful to transfer knowledge between domains and languages. In the
   cross-lingual experiment, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   joint-learning model also in out-domain scenarios.},

Abstract = {In the realm of natural language processing, tasks like emotion
   recognition, irony detection, hate speech detection, offensive language
   identification, and stance detection are pivotal for understanding
   user-generated content. While several task-specific and multitask
   learning models have been proposed, there remains a need for a unified
   framework that can effectively address these tasks simultaneously. This
   research introduces a novel unified framework designed to tackle
   multiple NLP tasks concurrently, aiming to outperform existing
   task-specific and multitask models in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and
   AUC-ROC. We compared our proposed framework against several baseline
   models, including task-specific models like SVM, RF, LSTM, CNN, and
   Cross-stitch Networks, MMoE, and T5. The performance was evaluated
   across various tasks, and statistical significance was assessed using
   the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Additionally, an ablation study was
   conducted to determine the contribution of individual components within
   our proposed method. The proposed framework consistently outperformed
   other models across all tasks. For instance, in emotion recognition, our
   model achieved an accuracy of 0.899, F1-score of 0.883, and AUC-ROC of
   0.971, surpassing all baseline models. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test
   further confirmed the statistical superiority of our model over the
   baselines across all datasets.},

Abstract = {Violent behavior detection has become a hot topic within computer
   vision. The problems such as diversity of monitoring scene, different
   crowd density and mutual occlusion among crowds etc. result in a low
   recognition rate for violent behavior detection. In order to solve these
   problems, this work proposes an improved method to detect violence
   sequences. Features which are obtained by combining a streakline model
   with a variational model are used to discriminate fight and non-fight
   sequences. Finally, the validity and accuracy of the algorithm are
   verified via a large amount of challenging real-world surveillance
   videos.},

Title = {User-aware multilingual abusive content detection in social media},
Journal = {INFORMATION PROCESSING \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {60},
Number = {5},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Despite growing efforts to halt distasteful content on social media,
   multilingualism has added a new dimension to this problem. The scarcity
   of resources makes the challenge even greater when it comes to
   low-resource languages. This work focuses on providing a novel method
   for abusive content detection in multiple low-resource Indic languages.
   Our observation indicates that a post's tendency to attract abusive
   comments, as well as features such as user history and social context,
   significantly aid in the detection of abusive content. The proposed
   method first learns social and text context features in two separate
   modules. The integrated representation from these modules is learned and
   used for the final prediction. To evaluate the performance of our method
   against different classical and state-of-the-art methods, we have
   performed extensive experiments on SCIDN and MACI datasets consisting of
   1.5M and 665K multilingual comments, respectively. Our proposed method
   outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods with an average increase
   of 4.08\% and 9.52\% in the F1-score on SCIDN and MACI datasets,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {In this paper we propose ResnetCrowd, a deep residual architecture for
   simultaneous crowd counting, violent behaviour detection and crowd
   density level classification. To train and evaluate the proposed
   multi-objective technique, a new 100 image dataset referred to as Multi
   Task Crowd is constructed. This new dataset is the first computer vision
   dataset fully annotated for crowd counting, violent behaviour detection
   and density level classification. Our experiments show that a multi-task
   approach boosts individual task performance for all tasks and most
   notably for violent behaviour detection which receives a 9\% boost in
   ROC curve AUC (Area under the curve). The trained ResnetCrowd model is
   also evaluated on several additional benchmarks highlighting the
   superior generalisation of crowd analysis models trained for multiple
   objectives.},

Journal = {PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 8},
Abstract = {Nowadays, social media experience an increase in hostility, which leads
   to many people suffering from online abusive behavior and harassment. We
   introduce a new publicly available annotated dataset for abusive
   language detection in short texts. The dataset includes comments from
   YouTube, along with contextual information: replies, video, video title,
   and the original description. The comments in the dataset are labeled as
   abusive or not and are classified by topic: politics, religion, and
   other. In particular, we discuss our refined annotation guidelines for
   such classification. We report a number of strong baselines on this
   dataset for the tasks of abusive language detection and topic
   classification, using a number of classifiers and text representations.
   We show that taking into account the conversational context, namely,
   replies, greatly improves the classification results as compared with
   using only linguistic features of the comments. We also study how the
   classification accuracy depends on the topic of the comment.},

Abstract = {Hate speech detection is hampered by the scarcity and topical and
   lexical biases of annotated data, leading to poor generalization. It is
   imperative to devise a cross-domain approach to solve this problem. The
   ability to learn transferable knowledge is critical for cross-domain
   hate speech detection. In this work, We propose a domain-adaptive
   dependency graph method based on post-hoc explanation (DPDG). We extract
   post-hoc explanations from fine-tuned BERT classifiers as the importance
   score for hate representation. Based on these, we construct in-domain
   graph and cross-domain graph to better learn in-domain hate
   representation and adapt to the target domain respectively. Finally, we
   use interactive GCN blocks to interactively and adaptively learn and
   adjust the domain adaptive graph representation. The results of
   cross-domain experiments on multiple domains show that our proposed
   model outperforms competitive baselines in cross-domain hate speech
   detection.},

Abstract = {In recent years, given the exponential increase in social media content
   also led to an increase in online hate speech. We need automatic hate
   speech detection methods due to the volume of data on the web. Various
   approaches have been proposed to address hate speech and offensive
   content on social media. This paper surveys how neural-based models have
   rapidly evolved to address hate speech on multilingual code-mixed data.
   We discuss the current state of the research in hate speech and
   offensive language detection on code-mixed Indian datasets.},

   supervised classifiers in the process of identifying hate speech on
   Twitter. More precisely, we do an empirical study that analyzes the
   influence of two types of linguistic features (n-grams, word embeddings)
   when they are used to feed different supervised machine learning
   classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB),
   Complement Naive Bayes (CNB), Decision Tree (DT), Nearest Neighbors
   (KN), Random Forest (RF) and Neural Network (NN). The experiments we
   have carried out show that CNB, SVM, and RF are better than the rest
   classifiers in English and Spanish languages by taking into account all
   features.},

Abstract = {With an aim to eliminate or reduce the spread of hate content across
   social media platforms, the development of artificial intelligence
   supported computational predictors is an active area of research.
   However, diversity of languages hinders development of generic
   predictors that can precisely identify hate content. Several
   language-specific hate speech detection predictors have been developed
   for most common languages including English, Chinese and German.
   Specifically, for Urdu language a few predictors have been developed and
   these predictors lack in predictive performance. The paper in hand
   presents a precise and explainable deep learning predictor which makes
   use of advanced language modelling strategies for the extraction of
   semantic and discriminative patterns. Extracted patterns are utilized to
   train an attention-based novel classifier that is competent in precisely
   identifying hate content. Over coarse-grained benchmark dataset, the
   proposed predictor significantly outperforms state-of-the-art predictor
   by 8.7\% in terms of accuracy, precision and F1-score. Similarly, over
   fine-grained dataset, in comparison with state-of-the-art predictor, it
   achieves performance gain of 10.6\%, 17.6\%, 18.6\% and 17.6\% in terms
   of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.},
